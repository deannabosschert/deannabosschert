### Hi there, and welcome to my resume üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

I'm Deanna, a front-end webdeveloper student from the Netherlands. Currently in my last year of studying Communication and Multimedia Design at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences. Passionate about lots of things, especially tech/design-related. Below are a few interesting stats about my time on GitHub. I've also written out my experience, knowledge, skills and some personal insights.
That's a lot of info that I'd normally just put on a print-like CV, but I thought I'd be nice to have this info collected in one place along with my projects' source code, and portfolio site. 

Visit [deannabosschert.nl](https://www.deannabosschert.nl/) for a showcase of my recent work.

## ‚öôÔ∏è  Skills
- It's such an overused mention in resumes, but perfectionism has proven itself to be very much present. It's a blessing and a burden, but becoming less **perfectionistic** whilst still having an extremely well **eye for detail** for when it's necessary is what I aim for right now. Best of both worlds!   
- I'm quite good at **writing in Dutch**; I rarely make spelling mistakes or grammar errors.   
- I'm always very **open for feedback**; I've learned so much this past year and it's mostly because I've just taken in so many advices from others   
- That being said; sometimes I'm kind of an open book and **not afraid to talk about the things I find hard or that I feel like is important**. It's the best and quickest way to get better at things, right?        
- Also **very open to learning new things**. It may sound like a clich√© but I actually like soaking up new information and gaining skills.     

## üè´  Education
- Received my **Propedeuse** of Communication and Multimedia Design in 2017   
- Graduated with a **pre-university degree** at the Jan van Egmond College in 2016.   

### üìãÔ∏è  Certificates
- In june 2016, I've obtained my **Cambridge Advanced English Certificate.**   

## üìà  Experience
- 2020-now: **Student assistent at the mostly tech-related courses** 'ISGA Project/Internetstandaarden' and 'Project Passie' in the first year of Communication and Multimedia Design, and 'Frontend Development' in the second year. Mostly personal assistance via video calls.
- 2017-2019: **Teaching assistant at a high school**; one year in **Tech-Science** for Sophomores ('brugklassen' in Dutch) and one year of **Computer Science** for Seniors    (eindexamenklassen) at the  Da Vinci college (HAVO/VWO).   
- 2017 (3 months): **Internship** at dnata in which I focused on **frontend** and developed an e-learning programme.   
- 2016-now: Lots of other student assistant work, and pre-'16 side jobs but that's a bit irrelevant for now   

### Volunteering
- I've volunteered for De Duiventil society as a **bar team member** for about 2 years.   
- I also occasionally **photographed** at events for IAM Core (see [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/IAMCoreCMDA/photos/?tab=album&ref=) for in which albums I'm tagged as photographer, for more) and generally liked to help out at events.   

#### IAM Core
IAM Core study society deserves a special place on this resume; I've started out as a member of the **'study trip committee'** in my first year, in which we organized a study trip to Lisbon. This was followed by a year in the **'game committee'** in which we organized gaming nights. After these two years, I did another year of participating and fulfilled the role of the **Treasurer of the association as board member**.
