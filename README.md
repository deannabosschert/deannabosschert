### Hi there, and welcome to my resume üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

I'm Deanna, a creative developer from the Netherlands. Just graduated from Communication and Multimedia Design at the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences as a webdeveloper and digital designer. Passionate about lots of things, especially tech/design-related. Below are a few interesting stats about my time on GitHub. I've also written out my experience, knowledge, skills and some personal insights.
That's a lot of info that I'd normally just put on a print-like CV, but I thought I'd be nice to have this info collected in one place along with my projects' source code, and portfolio site. 


Visit [deannabosschert.nl](https://www.deannabosschert.nl/) for a showcase of my recent work.  (**note: still a WIP**)

(contribution graph is a bit off as I worked mostly/only on projects in GitLab during my internship..)

## ‚öôÔ∏è  Skills
- It's such an overused mention in resumes, but perfectionism has proven itself to be very much present. It's a blessing and a burden, but becoming less **perfectionistic** whilst still having an extremely well **eye for detail** for when it's necessary is what I aim for right now. Best of both worlds!   
- I'm quite good at **writing in Dutch**; I rarely make spelling mistakes or grammar errors.   
- I'm always very **open for feedback**; I've learned so much this past year and it's mostly because I've just taken in so many advices from others   
- That being said; sometimes I'm kind of an open book and **not afraid to talk about the things I find hard or that I feel like is important**. It's the best and quickest way to get better at things, right?        
- Also **very open to learning new things**. It may sound like a clich√© but I actually like soaking up new information and gaining skills.     

## üè´  Education
- Graduated with a **bachelor's degree** from Communication and Multimedia Design in 2022, **thesis graded with a 10 (A++)**.     
- Received my **Propedeuse** of Communication and Multimedia Design in 2017   
- Graduated with a **pre-university degree** at the Jan van Egmond College in 2016.   

### üìãÔ∏è  Certificates
- In june 2016, I've obtained my **Cambridge Advanced English Certificate.**   

## üìà  Experience
- 2022+ **Teaching assistant** at the **Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences** for tech-focused courses.   
- 2021 aug-feb 2022: **Graduation project** at Active Collective, focused on developer efficiency enhancement.
- 2021 feb-juli: **Internship Creative Developer** at Active Collective (Digital Design Agency).
- 2020-2022: **Student assistent at the mostly tech-related courses** 'ISGA Project', 'Internetstandaarden' and 'Project Passie' in the first year of Communication and Multimedia Design, and 'Frontend Development' in the second year. Mostly personal assistance via video calls.
- 2017-2019: **Teaching assistant at a high school**; one year in **Tech-Science** for Sophomores ('brugklassen' in Dutch) and one year of **Computer Science** for Seniors    (eindexamenklassen) at the  Da Vinci college (HAVO/VWO).   
- 2017 (3 months): **Internship** at dnata in which I focused on **frontend** and developed an e-learning programme.   
- 2016-now: Lots of other student assistant work, and pre-'16 side jobs in retail and restaurants but that's a bit irrelevant for now   

### Volunteering
- I've volunteered for De Duiventil society as a **bar team member** for about 2 years.   
- I also occasionally **photographed** at events for IAM Core (see [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/IAMCoreCMDA/photos/?tab=album&ref=) for in which albums I'm tagged as photographer, for more) and generally liked to help out at events.   

#### IAM Core
IAM Core study society deserves a special place on this resume; I've started out as a member of the **'study trip committee'** in my first year, in which we organized a study trip to Lisbon. This was followed by a year in the **'game committee'** in which we organized gaming nights. After these two years, I did another year of participating and fulfilled the role of the **Treasurer of the association as board member**.
