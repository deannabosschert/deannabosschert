## Socials
🦄 Sometimes I tweet what's on my mind on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/tech_kech), or just share useful or important stuff   
🦄 Free images on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/@deannabosschert)   
🦄 Non-free images on [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/people/169241155@N05/)

🦄 My [LinkedIn](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/deannabosschert) is a bit abandoned but I'm always up for new connections   
🦄 [Codepen](https://codepen.io/deannabosschert) is used for a mix of quick examples and well.. less quick examples   

## Skills
🦄 It's such an overused mention in resumes, but perfectionism has proven itself to be very much present. It's a blessing and a burden, but becoming less perfectionistic whilst still having an extremely well eye for detail for when it's necessary is what I aim for right now. Best of both worlds!
🦄 I'm quite good at writing in Dutch; I rarely make spelling mistakes or grammar errors.
🦄 I'm always very open for feedback; I've learned so much this past year and it's mostly because I've just taken in so many advices from others

## Education
🦄 Received my Propedeuse of Communication and Multimedia Design in 2017
🦄 I've gotten my pre-university degree at the Jan van Egmond College in 2016.

## Certificates
🦄 In june 2016, I've obtained my Cambridge Advanced English Certificate.

## Experience
🦄 Teaching assistant at a high school; one year in Tech-Science for Sophomores ('brugklassen' in Dutch) and a year of Computer Science for Seniors (eindexamenklassen) at the  Da Vinci college (HAVO/VWO).
🦄 Internship at dnata in which I focused on frontend and developed an e-learning programme.
🦄 Student assistent at the courses 'ISGA Project/Internetstandaarden' and 'Project Passie' in the first year, and 'Frontend Development' in the second year of Communication and Multimedia Design 
🦄 Lots of other student assistant work but that's a bit irrelevant for now

### Volunteering
🦄 I've volunteered for De Duiventil as a bar team member for about 2 years.

🦄 I also occasionally photographed at events for IAM Core (see [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/people/169241155@N05/) for more) and generally liked to help out at events.

#### IAM Core
IAM Core study society deserves a special place on this resume; I've started out as a member of the 'study trip committee' in my first year, in which we organized a study trip to Lisbon. This was followed by a year in the 'game committee' in which we organized gaming nights. After these two years, I did another year as a board member and fulfilled the role of the Treasurer of the association.
